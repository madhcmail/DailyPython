# DailyPython 
I wish to code Python everyday.</br>
I wanted to commit atleast 1 program to this repo. </br>
This repo will conists of problems related to strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. 
I am planning to solve exercises from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-exercise/?ref=gcse
