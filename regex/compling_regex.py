# re module allows you to "complie" the expressions that you are searching for frequently.
# This will basically allow you to turn your expreession into a SRE_Pattern object
# you can then use that object in your search function.
# The rprimary reason for compling is to save it to be reused later on in your code.
# However, complie also take some flags that can used to enable various speacila features.
# When you compile patterns, they will get automatically cached 
# so if you arenâ€™t using lot of regular expressions in your code, 
# then you may not need to save the compiled object to a variable.
